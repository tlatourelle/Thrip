Some of the code in MvcIntegrationTestFramework was adapted from Chot’s CodeProject [1] article, some of the ideas came from a discussion at DDD South West with Richard Fennell who’s already doing something similar except with a dependency on TypeMock [2], and some bits of my HttpWorkerRequest simulation code were demonstrated years ago by Phil Haack in his HttpSimulator code, which is similar to MvcIntegrationTestFramework except it predates ASP.NET MVC.
