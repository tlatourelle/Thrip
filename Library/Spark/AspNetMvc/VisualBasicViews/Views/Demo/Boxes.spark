    "Will you walk a little faster?"
    <br/>
    Said a whiting to a snail,
    <br/>
    "There's a porpoise close behind us,
    <br/>
    And he's treading on my tail.
    <br/>
    See how eagerly the lobsters
    <br/>
    And the turtles all advance!
    <br/>
    They are waiting on the shingle -
    <br/>
    Will you come and join the dance?
    <br/>
    Will you, won't you, will you,
    <br/>
    Won't you, will you join the dance?
    <br/>
    Will you, won't you, will you,
    <br/>
    Won't you, won't you join the dance?

    "You can really have no notion
    <br/>
    How delightful it will be
    <br/>
    When they take us up and throw us,
    <br/>
    With the lobsters, out to sea!"
    <br/>
    But the snail replied, "Too far, too far!"
    <br/>
    And gave a look askance -
    <br/>
    Said he thanked the whiting kindly,
    <br/>
    But he would not join the dance.
    <br/>
    Would not, could not, would not,
    <br/>
    Could not, would not join the dance.
    <br/>
    Would not, could not, would not,
    <br/>
    Could not, could not join the dance.

    "What matters it how far we go?"
    <br/>
    His scaly friend replied.
    <br/>
    "There is another shore, you know,
    <br/>
    Upon the other side.
    <br/>
    The further off from England
    <br/>
    The nearer is to France -
    <br/>
    Then turn not pale, beloved snail,
    <br/>
    But come and join the dance.
    <br/>
    Will you, won't you, will you,
    <br/>
    Won't you, will you join the dance?
    <br/>
    Will you, won't you, will you,
    <br/>
    Won't you, won't you join the dance?
